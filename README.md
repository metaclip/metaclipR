# metaclipR

`metaclipR` is a package implementing the [METACLIP Provenance Framework](http://metaclip-interpreter.predictia.es/) in the R environment, specially tailored (although not restricted) to efficiently deal with the specificities of [`climate4R`](http://www.meteo.unican.es/climate4r), allowing for an easier abstraction of command calls and data structures to the entities defined in the [METACLIP vocabularies](https://github.com/Predictia/metaclip).
